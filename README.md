# DeadlockToolkit

A comprehensive Java application for visualizing, simulating, and analyzing deadlock scenarios in operating systems and distributed computing environments. This toolkit implements both the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock prevention and Resource Allocation Graph for deadlock detection, providing an educational and practical tool for understanding concurrency control mechanisms.

## 1. Project Overview

DeadlockToolkit is designed to help users understand and visualize deadlock scenarios that occur in resource allocation systems. It provides an interactive environment where users can:

- Create and configure multiple processes and resources
- Simulate resource allocation and request scenarios
- Detect potential and existing deadlocks
- Apply prevention techniques using the Banker's Algorithm
- Visualize the system state through resource allocation graphs
- Analyze the system through various matrix representations
- Navigate through the history of system states

This tool serves as both an educational platform for learning about deadlock concepts and a practical utility for testing resource allocation strategies.

## 2. Module-Wise Breakdown

### Core Components

- **DeadlockEngine**: The central component that manages the overall state of the system, coordinates between different modules, and implements the core logic for resource management.
  
- **ResourceAllocationGraph**: Represents the current state of resource allocation in the system as a directed graph, where nodes represent processes and resources, and edges represent allocation and request relationships.
  
- **BankersAlgorithm**: Implements the Banker's Algorithm for deadlock prevention, including safety checks and resource allocation validation.
  
- **DeadlockPrevention**: Contains strategies and algorithms to prevent deadlocks from occurring in the system.
  
- **DeadlockDetection**: Implements algorithms to detect existing deadlocks in the system state.

### UI Components

- **MainController**: The primary controller for the user interface, managing the setup, simulation, and analysis tabs.
  
- **VisualizationSystem**: Handles the graphical representation of the resource allocation graph and matrix views.
  
- **SimulationControls**: Provides interactive controls for manipulating the simulation state.
  
- **HistoryNavigator**: Allows users to move backward and forward through system states.

## 3. Functionalities
